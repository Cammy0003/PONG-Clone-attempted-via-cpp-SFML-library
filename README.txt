This is my play around with the SFML C++ game library, where I create a PONG clone. It is currently incomplete and I plan to push the finished code soon. 
The code is not to pretty, (a lot of nested statements ahhhh), and the game is not actually complete. However, the main purpose of this side hustle, was 
to basically practice and play around with SFML and better get a sense for the underlying foundations of game engines like 
Unreal, Unity, Gadot, etc. I'm certain I'll finish this and then make a full game in the near future with SFML.
