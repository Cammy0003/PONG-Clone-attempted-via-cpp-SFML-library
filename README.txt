This is my play around with the SFML C++ game library, where I attempted to create PONG clone. The code is not to pretty, 
(a lot of nested statements ahhhh), and the game is not actually complete. However, the main purpose of this side hustle, was 
to basically practice and play around with SFML and better get a sense for the underlying foundations of game engines like 
Unreal, Unity, Gadot, etc. I'm certain I'll make a full game in the near future with SFML.
